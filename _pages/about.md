I currently serve as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Macquarie University, where I am fortunate to work under the guidance of Professor Longbing Cao. Prior to this role, I was a two-year applied researcher at eBay, and I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW, where I was privileged to be mentored by Professors Lina Yao and Boualem Benatallah.

My research specialization centers on the domains of machine learning and deep learning methodologies, with a specific emphasis on natural language processing and anomaly detection.
