I am an applied researcher with a keen interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications. I was a two-year applied researcher at eBay, and I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW, where I was privileged to be mentored by Professors Lina Yao and Boualem Benatallah.

My research specialization centers on the domains of machine learning and deep learning methodologies, with a specific emphasis on natural language processing and anomaly detection.
